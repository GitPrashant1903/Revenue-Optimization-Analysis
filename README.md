# Revenue Optimization Analysis – Hospitality

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel revenue performance and identifying
opportunities to improve ADR, RevPAR, and occupancy through data-driven insights.

## Business Problem
The hotel experienced stagnant RevPAR despite stable demand.
The objective was to identify pricing, demand, and channel-level improvements.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Revenue KPIs, trend analysis)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Excel / CSV data
- GitHub for version control

## Key Analysis Performed
- Revenue, ADR, Occupancy, and RevPAR trend analysis
- Channel-wise revenue contribution
- Demand vs pricing gap identification
- High and low performing date analysis

## Key Insights
- ADR was underpriced on high-demand weekends
- OTA channels had higher commission impact on net revenue
- Midweek occupancy had scope for targeted pricing strategy

## Business Recommendations
- Increase BAR by 5–8% on high-demand dates
- Push direct bookings during midweek through offers
- Rebalance OTA contribution to reduce commission leakage

## Outcome
The analysis provides clear, actionable strategies to improve RevPAR
without increasing operational costs.
